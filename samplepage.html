            Comedy clubs are my favorite weekend outings. Rally some friends, grab a few drinks, and when a joke lands
            for us all—there’s a magical moment when our eyes meet, and we share a cheeky grin.<br>

            Smiling can turn strangers into the dearest of friends. It spurs meet-cute Hollywood plots, repairs broken
            relationships, and is inextricably linked to fuzzy, warm feelings of joy.<br>

            At least for people. For robots, their attempts at genuine smiles often fall into the uncanny valley—close
            enough to resemble a human, but causing a touch of unease. Logically, you know what they’re trying to do.
            But gut feelings tell you something’s not right.<br>

            It may be because of timing. Robots are trained to mimic the facial expression of a smile. But they don’t
            know when to turn the grin on. When humans connect, we genuinely smile in tandem without any conscious
            planning. Robots take time to analyze a person’s facial expressions to reproduce a grin. To a human, even
            milliseconds of delay raises hair on the back of the neck—like a horror movie, something feels manipulative
            and wrong.<br>

            Last week, a team at Columbia University showed off an algorithm that teaches robots to share a smile with
            their human operators. The AI analyzes slight facial changes to predict its operators’ expressions about 800
            milliseconds before they happen—just enough time for the robot to grin back.<br>

            The team trained a soft robotic humanoid face called Emo to anticipate and match the expressions of its
            human companion. With a silicone face tinted in blue, Emo looks like a 60s science fiction alien. But it
            readily grinned along with its human partner on the same “emotional” wavelength.<br>

            Humanoid robots are often clunky and stilted when communicating with humans, wrote Dr. Rachael Jack at the
            University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the study. ChatGPT and other large language algorithms can
            already make an AI’s speech sound human, but non-verbal communications are hard to replicate.<br>

            Programming social skills—at least for facial expression—into physical robots is a first step toward helping
            “social robots to join the human social world,” she wrote.<br>
